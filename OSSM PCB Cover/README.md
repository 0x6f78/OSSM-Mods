### OSSM - PCB Cover
A simple PCB cover that fits the OSSM just perfectly.

Currently, this cover is designed mainly for wired OSSM since it has a hole for the RJ485, however it can be used for wireless OSSM as well if you don't mind the RJ485 hole. Maybe in the future I'll add a version without the RJ485 hole.
